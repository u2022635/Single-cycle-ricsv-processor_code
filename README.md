# Single-cycle-ricsv-processor_code
This Verilog code implements a basic single-cycle RISC-V processor, handling instruction fetch, decode, execution, memory access, and write-back in one cycle. It includes a program counter, instruction memory, register file, ALU, control unit, and data memory, enabling execution of fundamental RISC-V instructions efficiently.
